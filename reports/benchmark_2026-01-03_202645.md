# ActaLog Benchmark Report

**Generated:** 2026-01-03 20:26:45 UTC

## Executive Summary

The benchmark completed successfully with **all checks passing**. The target ActaLog instance is healthy and responding within expected parameters.

## Test Parameters

The following parameters were used for this benchmark run:

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Target URL | `https://al.fluidgrid.site` |
| Target Version | 0.17.0-beta |
| Authenticated | true |
| User | br8kwall@gmail.com |
| Full Benchmark | true |
| Frontend Check | true |
| Timeout | 30s |
| Load Test Concurrent | 10 |
| Load Test Duration | 30s |

## Connectivity Analysis

Connectivity metrics measure the time required to establish a connection to the target server. These metrics help identify network-level bottlenecks that may affect application performance.

| Metric | Time (ms) | Description |
|--------|----------:|-------------|
| DNS Resolution | 1.68 | Time to resolve the hostname to an IP address |
| TCP Connect | 44.32 | Time to establish a TCP connection to the server |
| TLS Handshake | 49.47 | Time to complete the TLS/SSL handshake for HTTPS |
| **Total** | **95.47** | Total time to establish a secure connection |

### Interpretation

✅ **Excellent connectivity** - Connection time is under 100ms, indicating low network latency.

## Health Check

The health check verifies that the ActaLog application is running and responding to requests. A healthy status indicates the server and database connections are operational.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Status | ✅ healthy |
| Response Time | 57.70 ms |
| HTTP Status | 200 |

### Interpretation

✅ The application is healthy and all internal checks passed. Response time is within normal range.

## API Endpoint Performance

Each API endpoint was tested to measure response time and verify successful responses. Response times under 100ms are generally considered excellent for API endpoints.

| Endpoint | Response (ms) | Status | Result |
|----------|-------------:|-------:|--------|
| `/api/version` | 58.48 | 200 | ✅ |
| `/health` | 54.45 | 200 | ✅ |
| `/api/workouts` | 91.30 | 200 | ✅ |
| `/api/movements` | 61.69 | 200 | ✅ |
| `/api/wods` | 63.63 | 200 | ✅ |
| `/api/pr-movements` | 65.57 | 200 | ✅ |
| `/api/notifications/count` | 58.13 | 200 | ✅ |
| **Average** | **64.75** | | |

### Interpretation

- **7 of 7** endpoints returned successful responses
- ✅ **Good performance** - Average response time is under 100ms

## Frontend Asset Performance

Frontend assets (HTML, JavaScript, CSS) directly impact the initial page load experience. Smaller assets and faster load times improve user experience, especially on mobile devices.

| Asset | Size (KB) | Time (ms) | Result |
|-------|----------:|----------:|--------|
| `index.html` | 1.45 | 59.83 | ✅ |
| `/assets/index-Bh11ylPu.js` | 215.46 | 64.00 | ✅ |
| `/assets/index-3xSvSqMX.css` | 662.04 | 67.88 | ✅ |
| **Total** | **878.94** | **191.71** | |

### Interpretation

- **Total bundle size:** 878.94 KB
- **Total load time:** 191.71 ms

✅ **Good bundle size** - Total assets under 1MB are acceptable for most connections.

## Load Test Results

The load test simulates multiple concurrent users accessing the application simultaneously. This helps identify performance bottlenecks and capacity limits.

### Configuration

- **Concurrent Workers:** 10
- **Duration:** 30 seconds

### Throughput

| Metric | Value |
|--------|------:|
| Total Requests | 5371 |
| Successful | 5361 (99.8%) |
| Failed | 10 (0.2%) |
| **Requests/Second** | **179.03** |

### Latency Distribution

Latency percentiles show how response times are distributed across all requests. The p99 value indicates the worst-case latency experienced by 99% of requests.

| Percentile | Latency (ms) | Description |
|------------|-------------:|-------------|
| Min | 3.23 | Fastest response |
| p50 (Median) | 54.91 | Half of requests faster than this |
| p95 | 64.56 | 95% of requests faster than this |
| p99 | 133.88 | 99% of requests faster than this |
| Max | 187.03 | Slowest response |
| Average | 55.84 | Mean response time |

### Interpretation

At **10 concurrent users**, the server achieved **179.03 requests per second** with a **99.8% success rate**.

✅ **Good reliability** - Error rate under 1%.
✅ **Excellent latency** - 95th percentile under 100ms.

## Conclusion

✅ **PASS** - All benchmark checks completed successfully. The ActaLog instance is performing well.
